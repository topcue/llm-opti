# Description
Apply Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE) on trees optimization at assembly level.
Consider all branches of the functions. In this case, certain basic blocks contain instructions that do not always need to be executed.
In this case, create a new basic block using a new label and branch, and change the structure of the basic blocks so that a specific instruction is executed only when it is necessary or not when it is unnecessary.
