# Description

After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting, identify arithmetic instructions that compute processor flags similar to a comparison operation based on that arithmetic. If possible, eliminate the explicit comparison operation.

Apply this optimization only to certain targets where the comparison operation cannot be explicitly stated before register allocation is complete.

For example, `cmp EAX, 0x24; jz [Address1]; cmp EAX, 0x24; jg [Address2]` can be replaced with `cmp EAX, 0x24; jz [Address1]; jg [Address2]`
