# Description
Attempt to reorder instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.
Apply optimizations for memory load instructions by allowing the result of a load instruction to execute another instruction until it is needed.

Apply instruction scheduling optimizations after register allocation has been done.
This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.
