# Description
Omit the frame pointer in functions that donâ€™t need one. This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore the frame pointer; on many targets it also makes an extra register available.

That is, if possible, rsp should be used instead of rbp.
In addition, all index addressing modes using [rbp-*] must be calculated using [rsp+*].
(Values corresponding to * must also be recalculated.)
