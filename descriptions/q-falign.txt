# Description
Apply align-functions and align-jumps optimizations. The target is x64 architecture.

- Align-functions optimization
Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than n, skipping up to n bytes.

- Align-jumps optimization
Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to n bytes.
