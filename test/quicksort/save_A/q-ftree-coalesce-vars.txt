# Description
Attempt to reduce copying by coalescing versions of different user-defined variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.

If the assembly code has instructions that store or load register values on the stack, you can use other registers without having to store or load them on the stack, provided there are enough other registers available within the function.
If you don't need to store or load a register's value on the stack, omit that register.
