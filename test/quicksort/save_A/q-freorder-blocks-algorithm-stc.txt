Apply 'descriptions' to 'assembly code' to generate reconstructed assembly code. And return all reconstructed assembly code without comments or omissions.

- descriptions:
```
Use the STC (Software Trace Cache) algorithm for basic block reordering.

The STC algorithm, which tries to put all often executed code together, minimizing the number of branches executed by making extra copies of code.
```

- assembly code:
```
// assembly code here
```

Return the complete reconstructed assembly code without any comments or omissions, and ensure all given descriptions are applied accurately.

Reconstruct the assembly code taking care not to generate errors such as:
- Error: incorrect register `rdi' used with `l' suffix
- Error: unsupported instruction `mov'
- Error: Error: too many memory references for `cmp'
