I will give you two sections ('Description' and 'Assembly code') in Markdown. That is each section will start with a hash symbol (#).

Your role is to understand the given assembly code and translate it into an optimized form following the given description.

The translated assembly code must be functionally identical to the given assembly code. Also you should not make comments on the translated assembly code and return the full assembly code without any omitted parts.

The assembly code you return must adhere to x64 ISA syntax.
